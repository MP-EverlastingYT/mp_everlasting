I've always wanted to be a youtuber, thats why I made my channel. I love to upload when I have free time, but I also have to work on my STUDIES. I hope youtube could be my career so I don't have to get a job. (JK JK JK JK) Anywayz I live in Victoria, Australia in a Suburb which I love. I recently got into highschool, and is a big step in my life, considering I have been in primary school for like 6yrs. I am learning how to do HTML and CSS. My friend LucasCodes is helping me code because I suck, but knowing his advice will help me get on my feet and start coding by myself.</p></b></font>
